Wine Data Analysis to predict Wine Quality

Data: The data comprises of chemical composition properties of red and white wine. These properties include metrics that express the wine's acidity, amount of preservatives, sweetness, salinity, texture, pH and alcohol content.
Detailed information about the dataset can be found in the file named winequality.names. 

Data Source: 
https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Wine+Quality

Aim: The main aim of the project is to determine the quality of wine (low, medium or high) given its chemical composition properties. This has been done by 
implementing a Machine Learning classification workflow, along with EDA and cross-validation. 

Methods: 
1. Data cleaning: Removal of missing values, duplicate entries and outlier removal from the given data.
2. Present EDA findings. To check this out, please see the presentations folder. 
3. Set up a Machine Learning Classification pipeline. 
4. Present prediction results. To check this out, please see the presentations folder.
